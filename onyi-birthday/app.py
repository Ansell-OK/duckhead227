It's been a while since I wrote on of these so I am **rusty**. This is short notice but i felt like working on this little project while i code. I love you, I pray as you age gracefully
you continue to be a light in the darkness not just for yourself but for an entire generation looking up to you. I believe in your abilities and capabilities outside the square circle 
that is school and i am confifent that you will age gracefully and powerfully in the Light of the Lord. You have grown into a beautiful young lady with dreams that rival Joseph's. I can 
only pray your dreams become reality. Happy 20. I love you and Have a wonderful cake day.
